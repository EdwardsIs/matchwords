Overview:

This app that allows young learners to choose from three different lists, either animals, shapes, or foods.  After this, the program opens into “quiz mode”, where the user is quizzed on a list of items in the category chosen.  The application shows an image, and requires the user to input the name, allowing young learners to improve image recognition skills, vocabulary, and spelling abilities. 

Usage:

The app will open to a simple menu with three buttons, one for each category that the app supports.  The user can then press any button to launch the quiz for the category listed.  After this, an image is displayed, and the user must enter what they think it is into a textbox, and press the “Check” button to submit their answer.  The app will then display a pop-up informing the user whether or not they were correct.  Following the completion of whichever category was chosen, the user will be shown a breakdown of their final score, and they will be returned to the main menu, where they can choose another category, and start over.


Installation:

APK is provided within MatchWords/dist.  Download the .apk file, and move it to your android device.  Open the file with the Android package manager, and it will be installed, and available in your apps.
